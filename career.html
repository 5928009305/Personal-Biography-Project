	    <h2>Key Achievements</h2>
	        <p>I think that most people know that batman has obviously stopped the joker many times along slide with many other villains but more importantly is how he has beaten Superman a couple of times and a normal human which is an incredible feat as Superman is basically a god in the eyes of any human.</p><br>
            <p>Other things that help him in beating friends or foe are that he has mastery over several martial are that are known to man. Another thing is his incredible detective skills that has gotten him many victories. Last but not least are his Technological Innovations for example he uses many gadgets that aid him in battle but those are way above normal technological means.</p>
